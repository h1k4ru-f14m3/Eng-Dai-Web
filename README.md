# English to Dai Dictionary (Web)
This project is a dictionary app to check words from English in Dai. It is currently a web app and there is no official site yet. It can be run locally to use it, though I am planning to package this into an application later.

## Installation
There are mainly 2 ways to install this on your local machine.
